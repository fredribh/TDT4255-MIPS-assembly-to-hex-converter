# TDT4255-MIPS-assembly-to-hex-converter
A python script for converting MIPS instructions from assembly to hexadecimal values.

Are you working on the exercises in TDT4255, and find that testing on the FPGA is really tedious because you have to convert assembly instructions to little-endian hexadecimal values by hand?

Don't despair, because this script is here to save you some time.
